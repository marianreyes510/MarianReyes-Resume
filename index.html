        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am 19 years old, currently a second-year student at the University of California, Riverside. My major is currently undeclared, but I am completing the required classes to declare a psychology major. I have always been interested in psychology because it is fascinating to learn about mental processes and how that helps us understand the way we act and feel. I would like to earn a psychology major because there are multiple types of jobs that I could do, all of which involve working with and helping people. One specific job that interests me is clinical psychology because the focus is on mental health and also assessing, diagnosing, and treating mental, behavioral, and emotional disorders. I would like to help people reach a diagnosis and treat whatever they are going through because I personally know what it feels like to get misdiagnosed and to continue to feel bad healthwise.  <br><br>

        I graduated high school with high honors in 2019 and throughout my high school years I did internships, volunteered, and did extracurricular activites. One internship that I participated in was a LA Metro Internship at their headquarters. During this internship, I was given a position where the rails are operated and I was assigned a supervisor. I was given many tasks such as inputting information, creating worksheets with information, and was able to work on a group project promoting safety when using Metro services. Some of the volunteering I did was that I helped my 8-year-old neighbor by tutoring him and helping with all his school work. He would have trouble understanding many subjects such as Math and English and I would guide him by showing him different strategies and explaining things in different ways. I would also babysit him by attending him and making sure all his needs were met. An extracurricular activity I did was that all my four years of high school I took a college class every semester and summer from a local community college. I gained the college experience at a young age which helped me learn what to expect once I got to college. I took a variety of classes such as sociology, cinema, and politics. <br><br>

        Some other experience I have is that in high school I took an internship class and I was interviewed my many organizations. The place that chose me to be their intern was the Consulate General of El Salvador in Los Angeles, CA. Having parents from El Salvador, I felt privileged to be an intern there and see all that they do. I worked directly with the woman in charge and we did many tasks. I was able to be at the front desk helping people when they arrived with what service they wanted or filling out papers. One big project that I helped with was organizing a yearly event done by the embassy. Along with another intern we made dozens of cardboard lanterns of different colors so that they could be hung in the event. Those lanterns are a tradition in El Salvador. These are the experiences I have had working with people.
